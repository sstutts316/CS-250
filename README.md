#How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
#User stories are prioritized stories that have the needs and wants for some kind of functionality for business of the client. They are what we use during our Sprints. During the #Sprints we implement what the user needs into our code and then we can make sure it's exactly how the client wants it and then it can get deployed. User stories can help #understand the perspective of the end user.


#How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
#First we need to have a Sprint planning where we need to evaluate and prioritize the user stories. Then we have a Daily Scrum where we go over and inspect to make sure we are on #track for the Sprint goal. Then we have a Sprint review where we focus on the product being developed and adapt the Product Backlog as needed based on feedback. Then we have the #Sprint Retrospective where we discussed what went right and focus more attention on areas of improvement. 

#What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
#Each member of the team works together as one solid unit. They can all put eyes on the code to make sure that it looks good and test it as needed to make sure the program #functions the way that the clients want it to. Every team member should hold themselves accountable that everyone is doing their part and work cohesively.
